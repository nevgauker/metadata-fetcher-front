## Description

This Next.js project is a frontend application designed to dynamically generate and validate URLs using user input. It features a user-friendly interface where users can add multiple rows of URL inputs, combining a protocol selection (e.g., https://, http://) with a user-provided domain or path. The application ensures that each URL is valid and meets specific criteria before sending the URLs to a server for metadata retrieval, such as the page title, description, and image. The interface is built with React, TypeScript, and uses modern UI components for seamless user interaction.
